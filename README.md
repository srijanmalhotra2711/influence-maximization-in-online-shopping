# influence-maximization-in-online-shopping

The influence maximization problem is to find a set of seed nodes which maximize the spread of influence in a social network. The seed nodes are used for the viral marketing to gain the maximum profits through the effective word-of-mouth. However, in more real-world cases, marketers usually target certain products at particular groups of customers. While original influence maximization problem considers no product information and target customers, in this paper, we focus on the target marketing. We propose the labelled influence maximization problem, which aims to find a set of seed nodes which can trigger the maximum spread of influence on the target customers in a labelled social network.
